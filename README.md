## AltrayOS-Premium
This is a batch file-based mock-operating system made in 2025.

OS Password = Password

# The /src folder is meant to imitate a folder structure.

I suggest you move the file to the Desktop.
I also suggest using WinRar or 7-Zip for unzipping for better settings.
You must extract first the zip file after that keep it and go to next part.

After extracting you will see this format:
RayOS-Premium-Main -> RayOS-Premium-Main -> (other contents).
Drag the second folder out of the first folder and drag into Desktop.
Then resume with the instructions.

# To open the OS:
1. Press "Win"+"R" then type "cmd" then enter.
2. Type "cd C:\Users\admin\Desktop\RayOS-Premium-main" and enter.
3. Type "RayOS_Premium.bat" then enter.

Or you can just simply double-click the file.

# Available languages in the OS:
